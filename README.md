# Portfolio
Final Project â€“ Web Portfolio


For this assignment, I followed a process that involved creating a prototype using Adobe XD which I had learned in the User Experience Design course. I had already selected the layout, colours, fonts, and font sizes. With a visual blueprint of what I would be creating, I started coding using Visual Studio Code. I used the same navigation, background, and footer for each page and began with those. However, I faced some challenges while designing the portfolio page and contact page as they had different elements. I overcame these challenges by seeking support, researching online and applying the knowledge I gained from the course. Through this experience, I have learned a lot about web development.
